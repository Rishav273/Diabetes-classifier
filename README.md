# Diabetes-classifier
An ML application that classifies whether a patient is diabetic or not based on several features like Blood Pressure, Insulin levels, number of pregnancies, age, etc.
The result also returns a pedigree function that shows the patient's diabetic susceptibility accordingto family history.

To run the app, use anaconda environment as follows:

```
conda create --name <environemt name> python=3.8.5 pip
```

After the environment is created, head to the project directory using <cd> and run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The necessary dependencies should then be created.

Lastly, run the following:
```
python app.py
```
A <https> link should then appear in your terminal. Copy the link and paste it in your browser of choice. The app should be visible.
